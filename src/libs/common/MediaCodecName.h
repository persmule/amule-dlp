/**
 * Codec id (ffprobe codec_name or an eMule FOURCC / audio format define) to the label the
 * interface shows, e.g. "h264" or "X264" to "H.264".
 *
 * One table for every surface: the desktop reaches it through FormatMediaCodec() (OtherFunctions.h)
 * and amuleapi calls it directly when serialising `media.codec`, so a file reads the same in the
 * GUI, the REST rows and the SSE payload. Lives in mulecommon because EventDiff.cpp is one of those
 * callers and its test target is kept to a handful of sources.
 *
 * Matching is case-insensitive. An unmapped codec is returned unchanged, so something useful still
 * shows rather than nothing. Untranslated: these are labels, not messages.
