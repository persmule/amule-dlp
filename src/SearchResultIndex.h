/**
 * The per-search result index shared by the two search-list implementations.
 *
 * The search list has one implementation per build: CSearchList (monolithic, fed by the network
 * stack) and CSearchListRem (amulegui, fed over EC). Both are reached through the same
 * theApp->searchlist seam, and the GUI reads its rows from GetSearchResults() -- the wxDataViewCtrl
 * search model builds every row from it, so a result that is not indexed here is invisible, no
 * matter how correctly it arrived.
 *
 * That contract used to be satisfied by each implementation keeping its own copy of this map, which
 * is how the remote one came to never populate it at all (the pre-wxDataViewCtrl list control held
 * its own rows, so nothing broke visibly until the port made this map the row source). Keeping the
 * map here, with IndexResult() as the only way to add to it, means a new implementation cannot
 * answer GetSearchResults() correctly and still forget to fill it.
 *
 * Ownership deliberately stays with the derived class: the monolithic list owns its CSearchFile
 * objects, while the remote one only borrows pointers owned by its CRemoteContainer. This index
 * therefore never deletes anything -- DropResultIndex() drops the bookkeeping and leaves freeing to
 * the owner.
 *
 * What the index holds is part of the contract, not an implementation detail: TOP-LEVEL RESULTS
 * ONLY. A result grouped under another one (same hash, a different filename) is reachable through
 * its parent's GetChildren() and must not be indexed here, or GetSearchResults(id).size() stops
 * meaning "hits for this search" and consumers see each grouped result twice.
 *
 * Performance note for whenever result counts grow: UnindexResult() is a linear scan of one
 * search's list, so tearing down a whole search one result at a time (CRemoteContainer::FullReload,
 * which calls DeleteItem per item) costs O(N^2) in results per search. That is irrelevant at the
 * few hundred results a search returns today; if the caps ever rise, drop the whole index for the
 * search up front with DropResultIndex() rather than unindexing item by item.
