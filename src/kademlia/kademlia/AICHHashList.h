// KADEMLIA2_PUBLISH_KEY_REQ, and the indexing node accumulates those per entry and reports them in
// TAG_KADAICHHASHRESULT on KADEMLIA2_SEARCH_RES. The publisher count is the interesting part: an
// honest file has exactly one AICH hash, so several competing hashes -- or one hash with a single
// publisher against a popular file -- is the signal a searcher wants.
//
// Publishers hold their hash by index, so DropReferenceAt() only decrements the popularity
// counter and leaves the slot in place. Compact() is what actually removes the unreferenced ones
// and renumbers, and the caller must apply the returned map to every index it holds.
