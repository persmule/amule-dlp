//   * `is_shared` -- uploadable: a completed knownfile, OR a partfile with >=1 chunk
//     done (`EC_TAG_PARTFILE_SHARED=true`). Drives `/shared`, populated from
//     `EC_TAG_KNOWNFILE_*` children.
//
// Keying both roles on one ECID avoids the "shared cache has a ghost row with empty
// hash" bug: on a partfile-becoming-shared tick the server's CValueMap suppresses
// `EC_TAG_PARTFILE_HASH` because it was sent on a prior tick, but the unified entry
// already has hash + name from the downloads walker.
//
// Role-specific state lives in sub-blocks. On a role transition true->false the
// refresher resets that side's sub-block, so neither endpoint can serve stale stats.
