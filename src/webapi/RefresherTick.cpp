// One id-less EC_OP_SEARCH_RESULTS at EC_DETAIL_INC_UPDATE: the daemon answers with every result of
// every search it holds, incrementally. This replaced one EC_DETAIL_FULL roundtrip per active
// search, each carrying that search's whole result set every tick whether or not anything had
// changed. With eliding, an unchanged result costs nothing on the wire and an idle or finished
// search nothing at all -- which makes polling finished searches affordable, and is why the caller
// no longer filters on ActiveSearchIds().
//
// No single-search fallback: amuleapi advertises multi-search unconditionally and never checks
// whether the daemon supports it (App.cpp), so it has always required a matching daemon for search.
// EC_TAG_CAN_PARTIAL_SEARCH is advertised for every client of CRemoteConnect, so the daemon is
// already eliding for this connection.
//
// The mutex serialises the two issuers of the search stream across the roundtrip AND the apply.
// SendRecvSerialized only orders the roundtrips; both callers then take the State lock separately,
// so a union reply and a FULL reply can still be applied in the opposite order to the one they were
// fetched in. The union's tombstones are one-shot -- the daemon drops an ECID from
// io_lastSentResultIds as it emits EC_TAG_FILE_REMOVED for it -- so a stale FULL landing after a
// tombstone re-inserts a row nothing will ever remove. Held across the EC call, the same wait the
// EC worker already imposes; the State lock is always taken inside this one.
