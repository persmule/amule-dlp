// without media tags.

// The probe spawns ffprobe as a child and waits for it with a `timeoutMs` wall-clock bound, killing
// it on expiry. `keepRunning` is polled during the wait, so worker shutdown kills the child at once
// and the caller's join can complete. Both bounds mean a slow or hung ffprobe can never wedge the
// worker.

// 30-100 ms and at most `timeoutMs`.

//! Why a probe produced no metadata. The distinction matters because one of these is a statement
//! about the FILE and the rest about the environment: only the first justifies recording "this file
//! cannot be probed" and skipping it on later scans. Marking on the others would let a mistyped
//! ffprobe path, a spun-down disk or a shutdown mid-scan brand every file it touched as permanently

	// good ffprobe, exits non-zero, and is recorded as unprobeable. An SMB or NFS share can
	// lose a whole library's metadata to one bad moment that way.
