/**
 * What identifies a peer, once a peer can be IPv6.
 *
 * These value policies support peer-address widening at production call sites.
 * Socket ingress already canonicalizes mapped IPv4; local unmapping here stays defensive.
 *
 * Three separate questions live here, and they deliberately give different answers for the same
 * address:
 *
 *  - **Identity.** Two peers are the same peer iff they have the same index key. Aggregating
 *    distinct hosts here would merge them. Keeping absence separate from 0.0.0.0 is hardening,
 *    not a fix for an observed bug: a client constructed without a socket carries address 0, so
 *    an entry under that key would read back as banned for every such client -- but no path is
 *    known to insert it, since every Ban() call site reaches an address-bearing client. #1314
 *    guards the write side; see CBanRecord::Ban().
 *  - **Rate limiting.** A budget is per *subscriber*, which under IPv6 is not per address.
 *    Aggregating is the point here, and the amount of aggregation is a decision, not a detail.
 *  - **Routing an inbound datagram.** Some subsystems cannot represent an IPv6 peer at all --
 *    Kad by design, ed2k UDP obfuscation by protocol. Those boundaries are reported, never
 *    crossed with a fabricated address.
 *
 * Nothing here fabricates an address. Every function that cannot answer for an address says so;
 * an absent address stays absent all the way through.

 * pair -- see CEncryptedDatagramSocket::DecryptReceivedClient(), where the receiver derives it from
 * the sender's address, and EncryptSendClient() at the keyData[23] block, where the sender derives
 * it from its own public IPv4. There is no IPv6 input to that layout, so a native IPv6 peer has no
 * address to feed it and this build cannot obfuscate with one.
 *
 * That is a limit of what is implemented here, not of the protocol. emule-qt's ipv6-spec.md 3.4
 * defines a second layout for exactly this case -- 35 bytes, the same fields with the 16 IPv6 bytes
 * in network order in place of the 4 -- chosen from the source family rather than negotiated, which
 * leaves IPv4 bit-identical. It cannot be probed for: both layouts are valid key material, so a
 * wrong guess decrypts garbage that fails the magic-value check, indistinguishable from a peer that
 * did not obfuscate at all.
 *
 * Two traps in that layout. The magic byte sits at offset 32, not 20, because it follows the
 * address. eMuleAI v1.6 writes it at 20 and then copies the 16 address bytes over 16 to 31
 * (EncryptedDatagramSocket.cpp:227 and :338), so the magic is clobbered and byte 32 is never
 * written at all, putting a byte of stack in the key: that end cannot reproduce its own key, let
 * alone agree with a conforming one. And the IPv4 field is a host-order uint32 written in native
 * byte order, a historical quirk that breaks every existing IPv4 peer if it is "corrected".
 *
 * Implementing it depends on ingress normalisation landing first. A mapped IPv4 sender has to
 * become plain IPv4 before this question is asked, or the receiver picks the 35-byte layout for a
 * peer that keyed on 4 bytes and fails silently.
 *
 * Feeding the current derivation a zero would produce a wrong key, the packet would fail its
 * magic-value check and be handled as junk, and nothing would record why. So the boundary is
 * reported here instead.
