# amuleapi /downloads, /downloads/{hash}, /shared. Exercises the
# consolidated GET_UPDATE @ EC_DETAIL_INC_UPDATE polling path end-
# to-end, the ECID-keyed state cache, the auth gate, and the bare-
# object detail shape.
#
# This smoke is intentionally tolerant of empty caches — it asserts
# the envelope shape and the per-item field types without requiring
# a specific download / upload / shared file to exist on the daemon.
# Field-content correctness is exercised by the unit tests against
# crafted EC packets, and by the live test the dev runs against
# their daemon (`./build-macos/src/webapi/amuleapi ...` →
# `curl /downloads | jq`).
