#
# Orchestrator for the amuleapi curl-smoke matrix.
#
# Brings up a fresh amuleapi daemon for each script, runs the
# script, and aggregates pass/fail. The fresh-daemon-per-script
# pattern isolates state — most importantly, 02-auth.sh fires the
# rate-limit lockout (5 failed logins → 300 s IP lockout) which would
# block every subsequent script's /auth/login. Restarting wipes the
# in-memory CRateLimiter buckets.
#
# Setup per phase:
#   1. pkill any running amuleapi
#   2. wipe + recreate /tmp/amuleapi-regtest config dir
#   3. set admin pass (one-shot CLI invocation, daemon exits)
#   4. set guest pass (second one-shot — App.cpp's set-pass paths are
#      mutually exclusive, so admin and guest need separate runs)
#   5. start the daemon in foreground, log to /tmp/amuleapi.log
#   6. sleep 5 s for the refresher to populate its caches (first
#      GET_UPDATE tick is the heaviest — sends every alive ECID with
#      full identity)
#   7. run the phase script
#
# Usage:
#   ./run-all.sh                                                 # run every script in
#                                                                # the canonical order
#   ./run-all.sh 12-downloads-add-patch.sh 13-downloads-delete-clear.sh  # run a subset

# A subset run (`./run-all.sh 04-...`) replaces this list wholesale, so it gets
# no fixture and no teardown; name 00 and 99 explicitly to exercise that path.
